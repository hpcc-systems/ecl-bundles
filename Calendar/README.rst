ecl-bundles
===========

This repository has been created as a 'testing ground' for new ECL bundle development.
Bundles that are accepted into this repository have passed initial review and testing
by HPCC Systems team, but are ultimately maintained by the original authors.

At some point we will provide a mechanism for searching and downloading individual
bundles from this repository. Until that point, to use a bundle from here, it is 
necessary to clone the whole repository first, then install the individual bundle file
or directory using the ecl bundle tool.

For more information about how to create an Ecl bundle, see the `Ecl Bundle Writer's Guide`_.

ECL bundles repository
======================

This repository serves as a central list of all known ECL bundles.

Bundles listed here fall into three categories:

Supported bundles
  are maintained by the HPCC platform team, and tested against each release.

Approved bundles
  are maintained by external contributors, but have passed initial review
  and testing by the HPCC platform team and thus should be considered stable and safe to
  use, and should remain compatible across platform versions

Other bundles
  are created and maintained by external contributors, and have not been
  approved by the platform team. Use at your own risk

If you have developed a bundle that you would like to add to any of these lists, create
a pull request against this file to add your bundle's repository to the appropriate list.

For more information about how to create an Ecl bundle, see the `Ecl Bundle Writer's Guide`_.

ecl-bundles
===========

This repository has been created as a 'testing ground' for new ECL bundle development.
Bundles that are accepted into this repository have passed initial review and testing
by HPCC Systems team, but are ultimately maintained by the original authors.

Individual bundles that have passed the initial testing phase have been moved to the
https://github.com/ecl-bundles site. These can be installed individually directly from
the ecl-bundle tool. To use a bundle from this repository, it is necessary to clone
the whole repository first, then install the individual bundle file or directory using
the ecl bundle tool.

For more information about how to create an Ecl bundle, see the `Ecl Bundle Writer's Guide`_.

MLUsageExamples contains small example ECL programs that illustrate how to use the functions
and macros in the Machine Learning (ML) library. Each of these examples are stand-alone except
for the need of ML. To execute any of them, you only need the ML library in your repository.

The number of example programs in this bundle will increase over time.

ORGANIZATION

The folders in this bundle are organized like the ML library's folder structure. For example
an example of how to use ML.Mat.Add will be found in the Mat folder because ML.Mat.Add.ecl
is in the ML/Mat folder of the ML library. Furthermore, modules of the ML library
will have  examples in a folder named after the module. For example, examples of how to use
the functions of the ML.Mat.Each.ecl module will be found in the folder MLUsageExamples/Mat/Each.
